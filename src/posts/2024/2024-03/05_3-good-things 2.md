My 2nd post on my new 11ty website, listing 3 good things that happened today.

1. Started the day with my regular long espresso made with Brighton Lanes beans from CoffeeCompass.
2. No clients today, so I made good progress with technical how-to documents for my colleagues.
3. For the first time this year I walked the last leg of my journey home under a blue sky with the sun shining!
