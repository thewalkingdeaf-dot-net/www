Yay! It's Friday! In addition, here are 3 good things that happened during my day:

1. Pay day! What's not to like?
2. Last day of one of my projects at work. Kinda sad, but it means I can move on to the next one. Exciting!
3. Relaxed lunch at Nando's with my interpreter. Garlic chicken sandwich. Lovely!
