I'm trying to get into the habit of regularly remembering three good things that have happened during the day. Here are today's.

1. Had an early appointment for my 3-monthly jabs. I should start to feel more human in the next few days.
2. It's far from the best, but sitting and drinking a Starbuck's capuccino and watching the world go by whilst relaxing and waiting for a train is a long way from unpleasant.
3. The train did arrive, on time, and wasn't held up on the track anywhere on the way home. Much better than the tram!
