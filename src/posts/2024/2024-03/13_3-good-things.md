I'm trying to stick to the habit of recording three good things that happened to me during the day. Here's today's list.

1. We received more updates from the lady that runs the Romanian dog rescue charity. The object of our affections is putting on weight nicely, is becoming really affectionate towards people, and we could get to meet and greet him sometime soon.
2. The Wellbeing Group walk in Heaton Park was nice, if a little damp from the constant drizzle. Good exercise, and a chance to get a good look at the changes happening in nature.
3. My colleague convinced me to go with him to 5 Guys for delayed lunch. Expensive, but really tasty!
