Good day today, despite feeling a bit bleh! this morning...

1. Full English breakfast first thing. Great way to start the day! (HP sauce, of course)
2. Working in the garden to clear all the Winter algae from the stone flags, plant pots and containers sorted out for Spring.
3. Signs of new life by way of fresh leaves and bud burst amongst most of the plants. Here comes Spring!
