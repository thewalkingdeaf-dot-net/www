I'm going to try to get into the habit of listing 3 Good Things that happened during the day.
Without further ado, here are today's.

1. The First Aid course at work went very well. The trainer hadn't presented to a Deaf team before, lots of challenges that he hadn't anticipated (hearing people just don't). He managed okay thanks to our lovely interpreters. Everyone passed and we await out certificates.
2. My website design choices are finished for now.
3. My evening train wasn't cancelled and it only took me an hour to travel the 7 miles from work to home.
