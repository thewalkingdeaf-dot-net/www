#### This week the BSL community is celebrating Sign Language Week!

Why this week? Back in March 2003 the British government finally approved and recognised British Sign Language.

Every year, the British Deaf Association (BDA) organise Sign Language Week to mark the victory.

This year, the theme is Promotion of BSL.

It's the perfect opportunity to pester friends and family to apply for a BSL course to start learning BSL!
