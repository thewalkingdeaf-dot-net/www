My first foray with the lovely [North West Fungus Group](https://northwestfungusgroup.com/) was about an hour's drive from home and into Flintshire.

Always anxious when meeting new people, I arrived early and waited in the lay-by for others to turn up. We introduced ourselves and then set off in search of visible fungi after a caution that the weather had been particularly dry of late and there was a good chance that we wouldn't come up with much.

Almost immediately though, some members of the group had found bramble leaf rust _Phragmidium violaceum_ and oak leaf powdery mildew _Erysiphe alphitoides_.

A short time later we came across small black fingers of the Candlesnuff fungus growing up from rotting tree stumps on the ground.

A few steps later and we's spotted Turkey Tail Trametes versicolor growing on fallen tree branches.

Someone spotted a Mica Cap, showing the shiny little flakes that give its name.
