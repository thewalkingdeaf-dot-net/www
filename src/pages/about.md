It's taken me quite a while to get around to setting up my own little corner of the web..

I finally settled with 11ty [(https://www.11ty.dev/)](https://www.11ty.dev/) and this starter theme, the very appropriately named Eleventy Excellent [(https://github.com/madrilene/eleventy-excellent)](https://github.com/madrilene/eleventy-excellent) that I've adapted to my own purposes. 

There's lots more I can do with it, but I'm not going to rush. It's going to be a slowly-evolving kind of deal, I think.

#### Who?

So here I am, a gen-X neurodivergent Deafie from the North West of England.

I decided to put this website together to do my bit for the small web, one of a growing number of outlets providing an internet experience the way it was meant to be - by the people for the people. For years I've been railing against the *enshittification* of the web and the services it decreasingly attempts to deliver. 

One of the good things to come out of technology of late is the static site generator. Moving away from massively complicated and unwieldy databases, this new method presents web pages using (mostly) just good ol' HTML for speed. I've seen Jekyll and Hugo, but now 11ty has come alomng and is swiftly becoming the darling of front-end developers. Oh, I'm not a developer by the way - at least not in any real sense. That's one of the good points about 11ty; duffers like me can pick up a starter template, customise it to their needs and learn about the internals of the platform as they go along.
