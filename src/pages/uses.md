#### Daily driver kit

At home, my main workhorse is a coping-extremely-well 27" late 2013 Intel Mac, running Sonoma 14.2.1 by way of the awesome [Open Core Legacy Patcher](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher/).
- Boots from 2TB external SSD
- 3.5GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i7
- NVidia GeForce GTX 775M 2GB
- 32GB 1600MHz DDR3 RAM
