#### Here be (bearded) dragons!

Hello there! It's taken me quite a while to get around to setting up my own little corner of the web. I finally settled with 11ty [(https://www.11ty.dev/)](https://www.11ty.dev/) and this starter theme, Eleventy Excellent [(https://github.com/madrilene/eleventy-excellent)](https://github.com/madrilene/eleventy-excellent) that I've adapted to my own purposes. there's lots more I can do with it, but I'm not going to rush. It's going to be a slowly-evolving kind of deal, I think.
