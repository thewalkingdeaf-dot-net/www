<p>I’m trying to get into the habit of regularly remembering three good things that have happened during the day. Here are today’s.</p>
<ol class="list">
<li>Had an early appointment for my 3-monthly jabs. I should start to feel more human in the next few days.</li>
<li>It’s far from the best, but sitting and drinking a Starbuck’s capuccino and watching the world go by whilst relaxing and waiting for a train is a long way from unpleasant.</li>
<li>The train did arrive, on time, and wasn’t held up on the track anywhere on the way home. Much better than the tram!</li>
</ol>
