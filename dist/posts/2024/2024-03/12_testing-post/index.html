<p>I’m going to try to get into the habit of listing 3 Good Things that happened during the day.<br>
Without further ado, here are today’s.</p>
<ol class="list">
<li>The First Aid course at work went very well. The trainer hadn’t presented to a Deaf team before, lots of challenges that he hadn’t anticipated (hearing people just don’t). He managed okay thanks to our lovely interpreters. Everyone passed and we await out certificates.</li>
<li>My website design choices are finished for now.</li>
<li>My evening train wasn’t cancelled and it only took me an hour to travel the 7 miles from work to home.</li>
</ol>
