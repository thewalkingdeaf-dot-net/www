<p>My 3rd post on my new 11ty website, listing 3 good things that happened today!</p>
<ol class="list">
<li>Started the day with my regular long espresso made with Brighton Lanes beans from CoffeeCompass.</li>
<li>No clients today, so I made good progress with technical how-to documents for my colleagues.</li>
<li>For the first time this year I walked the last leg of my journey home under a blue sky with the sun shining!</li>
</ol>
