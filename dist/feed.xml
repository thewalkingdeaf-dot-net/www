    &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We discovered something interesting about our new boy Fyodor today. 🙂&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We took him for a long walk around the park again, and he met a few other dogs with the calm demeanour we’re getting used to with him. He really doesn’t seem to like getting his paws muddy though, and will go round puddles rather than walk through them. We had a funny incident when Jean walked over a wooden plank crossing a really muddy patch, and Fyo decided he was going to stay clean by walking over the plank too! 😆&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We came across the swinging metal gate that concerned him the first time we went through it, and he managed to navigate it with only a little encouragement from behind. He’ll have the hang of it after a few more goes through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last couple of days I’ve been picking up a few signals about his hearing. I’ve been getting the distinct impression that he responds to vibration rather than sounds. I was watching him today as cars approached us from behind on the road, and noticed that he only responds as they pass and go through his field of vision. He doesn’t respond at all to traffic approaching from the front. My suspicions were strengthened when loud noises happened behind us that even I could hear, and he didn’t respond. Occasionally he appears surprised that things are happening behind him unnoticed, such as the woman jogging and brushing past us. When we got home I waited until he was lying on his bed facing away from us, and I rattled the tub of treats, called his name and rustled a plastic bag. No response. Same with general shouting and clapping. No response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; Fyo’s deaf, and as you can imagine we love him all the more for it! 🥰&lt;br /&gt;
We’ll have to take it into consideration going forward and make allowances for him.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We reversed the direction of the walk round the park today and added a bit extra with the loop at the top, for a total of 7.5km. Fyo coped with the extra distance just fine and really seems to be enjoying the exercise!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fyodor&#39;s first proper walk</title>

    &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We took Fyodor for his first proper walk today. The weather decided to give us a break, and the sun came out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We decided to go round a local park to let him experience the sights and sounds of the area and to get a proper assessment of his behaviour when meeting ofher dogs and people. I’m delighted to report that he’s a delight to take out for a walk. He’s really accomodating with people he doesn’t know, so long as they don’t try to pat the top of his head or back. He’s still really touch sensitive in those areas, and we let people know it’s better to stroke under his chin; he really likes that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He’s pretty much unresponsive to the approach of other dogs, but will reciprocate with a curious sniff if that’s what he’s presented with. He met quite a few other dogs during the walk and we’re learning to trust in his indifference. He met an over-inquisitive elderly staffy that he was really tolerant of, and he remained aloof when a huge, young and bouncy GSD almost bowled him over on the path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His lead-walking is pretty good. He doesn’t pull, which is a huge relief, but has a tendency to veer under my feet if I allow him to get a little too far in front. The slightest pressure through the lead corrects this though, and I’m sure it’ll get better in time when he’s walked a lot more with us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He has a habit of doing an occasional happy little gallop before settling back into his normal gait, although this is more endearing than problematic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He took the distance in his stride, and he seemed to really enjoy the exercise! I don’t think he’s walked through too many muddy puddles in the past, but his confidence doing this will improve in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After weeks of anticipation, Fyodor is here at home with us!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A rescue from a Romanian shelter, he’s been in the UK for around 5 weeks but has made amazing progress given the emaciated, abused state he arrived in. Major credits go to his foster mum who’s made great progress with his confidence and slowly feeding him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He’s a 9 year-old neutered black Labrador cross (possibly Staffy or Rotty) and has had a really bad time of things prior to coming to the UK. He’s been attacked by other dogs in the shelter and had horrific injuries to heal. Thankfully he’s pretty much all healed physically, but we know it’s going to take a while to get over his psychological trauma. Of course, we’re willing and able to help gently lead him through it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’d seen videos and photos of him before going to see him last Sunday and making arrangements to adopt him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was dropped off at around 11am and has been settling in really well. So far his favourite thing appears to be sliced ham.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why this week? Back in March 2003 the British government finally approved and recognised British Sign Language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every year, the British Deaf Association (BDA) organise Sign Language Week to mark the victory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, the theme is Promotion of BSL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s the perfect opportunity to pester friends and family to apply for a BSL course to start learning BSL!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why not &lt;a href=&quot;https://thewalkingdeaf.social/@steve/112118238391458356&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;reply to my Fedi post&lt;/a&gt; by showing me your name in your Sign Language? Include your sign name if you have one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good day today, despite feeling a bit bleh! this morning…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Full English breakfast first thing. Great way to start the day! (HP sauce, of course)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Working in the garden to clear all the Winter algae from the stone flags, plant pots and containers sorted out for Spring.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Signs of new life by way of fresh leaves and bud burst amongst most of the plants. Here comes Spring!&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yay! It’s Friday! In addition, here are 3 good things that happened during my day:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pay day! What’s not to like?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Last day of one of my projects at work. Kinda sad, but it means I can move on to the next one. Exciting!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Relaxed lunch at Nando’s with my interpreter. Garlic chicken sandwich. Lovely!&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our Wellbeing group had another visit from Molly from SignHealth today, and she brought her colleague Sue to help out. They gave us a presentation on healthy relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We learned about what makes a relationship healthy, and why it’s important for us to work towards one. They also taught us how to spot the warning signs of an unhealthy relationship, and how to deal with various forms of abuse that can occur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had a lunch break and then we resumed for the last section that dealt with bad behaviours like stalking and sexting, and what to do about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Molly and Sue are great presenters, and communication through BSL to our Deaf clients without having to rely on interpreters. This helps the audience stay engaged, and helps better retention of information.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Doggo update, Heaton Park and 5Guys</title>

      >&lt;p&gt;I’m trying to stick to the habit of recording three good things that happened to me during the day. Here’s today’s list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We received more updates from the lady that runs the Romanian dog rescue charity. The object of our affections is putting on weight nicely, is becoming really affectionate towards people, and we could get to meet and greet him sometime soon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Wellbeing Group walk in Heaton Park was nice, if a little damp from the constant drizzle. Good exercise, and a chance to get a good look at the changes happening in nature.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My colleague convinced me to go with him to 5 Guys for delayed lunch. Expensive, but really tasty!&lt;/li&gt;

      >&lt;p&gt;I’m no stranger to dogs. I grew up in a family where there was always at least one Golden Retriever around. There was only a couple of years after I left home that there wasn’t one in the background or stuck to my side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that more than 12 months have passed since we lost Chip Dogg, we’re more open to taking on another dog in need of a home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- &lt;figure class=&quot;flow&quot;&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;/assets/images/chip-dogg-10w.webp 10w, /assets/images/chip-dogg-20w.webp 20w, /assets/images/chip-dogg-50w.webp 50w, /assets/images/chip-dogg-100w.webp 100w, /assets/images/chip-dogg-210w.webp 210w, /assets/images/chip-dogg-440w.webp 440w, /assets/images/chip-dogg-880w.webp 880w, /assets/images/chip-dogg-1024w.webp 1024w&quot; sizes=&quot;90vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/png&quot; srcset=&quot;/assets/images/chip-dogg-10w.png 10w, /assets/images/chip-dogg-20w.png 20w, /assets/images/chip-dogg-50w.png 50w, /assets/images/chip-dogg-100w.png 100w, /assets/images/chip-dogg-210w.png 210w, /assets/images/chip-dogg-440w.png 440w, /assets/images/chip-dogg-880w.png 880w, /assets/images/chip-dogg-1024w.png 1024w&quot; sizes=&quot;90vw&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; srcset=&quot;/assets/images/chip-dogg-10w.jpeg 10w, /assets/images/chip-dogg-20w.jpeg 20w, /assets/images/chip-dogg-50w.jpeg 50w, /assets/images/chip-dogg-100w.jpeg 100w, /assets/images/chip-dogg-210w.jpeg 210w, /assets/images/chip-dogg-440w.jpeg 440w, /assets/images/chip-dogg-880w.jpeg 880w, /assets/images/chip-dogg-1024w.jpeg 1024w&quot; sizes=&quot;90vw&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/chip-dogg-1024w.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;768&quot; alt=&quot;Border collie resting on the crest of a grassy, flowery hill with rolling Welsh hills and a lightly clouded sky behind him.

&lt;p&gt;We’ve been put in touch through a friend with a lady who runs a charity that rescues dogs from Romanian kill shelters and re-homes them in the UK. We’ve been to see one already, but we just didn’t feel that we were the adoptive family for him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another one, a young black Lab (possibly Staffie cross from the photos and videos I’ve seen) that has had a terrible time in the shelter environment. He’s been brutally attacked by other dogs and although his terrible physical wounds have healed, his emotional scars might take a bit longer. We’ve agreed that we’re more than ready to give the time and love to help him become happy and trusting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a bit of delay as the charity lady has had some issues to sort out, but she’s going to visit him in his foster home again soon and hopefully invite us for a meet and greet in the coming weeks. He has progressed really well since landing in the UK, and he now accepts wearing a collar and he appears to be really affectionate. It’s lovely to see him wagging his tail nearly all the time, and he’s slowly putting on weight from the emaciated state he arrived in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fingers crossed we get to meet him soon!&lt;/p&gt;

      >&lt;p&gt;I’m trying to stick to the habit of recording three good things that happened to me during the day. Here’s today’s list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I got my og:image functionality working! There was an error in the template that I’m using that was allowing white space to collect around the URL derived by the build script. A call out to the Fedi community saw @11ty respond and put me on the right track by recommending I remove the white space. Ta-da! It works.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At least one of my Employability clients today had me in stitches just by being themselves. I love Manchester’s Deaf community. Please don’t ever change!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Waiting for the train home, a server behind the counter at the coffee shop asked if I wanted my cinnamon swirl bun heated up. After I’d got over the culture shock I decided to give it a try. Honestly, game-changer!&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Busy day with the servers!</title>

      type="html"
      >&lt;p&gt;Things I had planned for today included installing the &lt;a href=&quot;https://lms-community.github.io/lms-server-repository/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Logitech Media Server&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on my dev server, since &lt;a href=&quot;http://mysqueezebox.com/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;mysqueezebox.com&lt;/a&gt; have now dropped the service. You have to run your own server now if you want to listen to internet radion on a Squeezebox Boom in the kitchen like my better half does. It’s not such a problem for me being Deaf, but she likes music playing in the kitchen during the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not a problem, I’ve used it loads in the past, and it’s an easy install on one of the Debian servers. Before I installed it, I thought I might as well upgrade the Debian from &lt;em&gt;Bullseye&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;Bookworm&lt;/em&gt;. So I made the changes in &lt;code&gt;/etc/apt/sources.list&lt;/code&gt; and did a soft &lt;code&gt;apt update --no-new-packages&lt;/code&gt; before a final &lt;code&gt;apt full-upgrade&lt;/code&gt;. I remember thinking a lot of familar-looking packages were being removed but went with it anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mistake came to light when I was setting up the LMS app and saw it was mis-reporting the server it was installed on; &lt;em&gt;social&lt;/em&gt; instead of &lt;em&gt;dev&lt;/em&gt;. Hmmm. I just carelessly upgraded an important server without meaning to, or planning for it? Ouch!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Checking on the status of &lt;em&gt;social&lt;/em&gt;, where my Fedi services live, I noticed that my &lt;a href=&quot;https://pix.thewalkingdeaf.social/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pixelfed&lt;/em&gt; instance&lt;/a&gt; was hosed with at DB connection problem. It took a few minutes of head-scratching before I realised &lt;code&gt;php8.2-mysql&lt;/code&gt; had been removed. Luckily, all I had to do was reinstall this to get things rolling again. I also took the opportunity to update to the latest &lt;em&gt;v0.11.13&lt;/em&gt; whilst I was at it. Thank you, @dansup@pixelfed.social !&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pixelfed sorted, I thought I may as well update my &lt;a href=&quot;https://thewalkingdeaf.social/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Mastodon instance&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;em&gt;v4.2.8&lt;/em&gt; whilst I was at it. No problems here, smooth upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was about to move the &lt;em&gt;LMS&lt;/em&gt; setup to the dev server when I remembered that I’d been considering setting up my media server again. I’d decommisioned it months ago as I’ve fallen into the trap of subscribing to quite a few streaming services and didn’t really need it any more. I decided to set up the box, and move the &lt;em&gt;LMS&lt;/em&gt; server there; a more appropriate home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That out of the way, the main thing was to get &lt;a href=&quot;https://sabnzbd.org/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;sabnzbd&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; up and running, using my usenet account. I tried to use my Hetzner storagebox as a storage space at first, but there was far too high a network bottleneck, and I had to abandon that idea. I found a couple of 1TB HDDs in the pile of spares and installed them in the server, removing the connection to the storagebox. I created a LVM group with both drives used. This will suffice until I get a bigger HDD to add to the pool. I created the &lt;a href=&quot;https://trash-guides.info/Hardlinks/How-to-setup-for/Native/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;folder structure recommended by the servarr team&lt;/a&gt; and amended the folders inside sabnzbd. I then installed &lt;a href=&quot;https://sonarr.tv/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;sonarr&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and used my nzbgeek account for indexing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I rely on subtitles for TV series that I like to watch, and some of the streaming services have been letting me down with either no subtitles at all (Prime TV, Fargo series 4), or really out of sync ones (most things on Paramount). My experience in the past with TV shows and films downloaded from usenet has been really positive, so I’m shifting my focus back to that and saving some money cancelling my subscriptions to the services that don’t deliver or arren’t interested in &lt;em&gt;accessibility&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have my &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.servarr.com/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;servarr&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; apps accessible through a reverse proxy by way of &lt;em&gt;HAProxy&lt;/em&gt; package on my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pfsense.org/products/#requirements&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;pfSense&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; router.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll add &lt;a href=&quot;https://radarr.video/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;radarr&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; soon, along with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bazarr.media/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;bazarr&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for subtitles (I have an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.opensubtitles.com/en&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;opensubtitles&lt;/a&gt; subscription) and a few other apps that I used to use before.&lt;/p&gt;

      >&lt;p&gt;I’m trying to get into the habit of regularly remembering three good things that have happened during the day. Here are today’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Had an early appointment for my 3-monthly jabs. I should start to feel more human in the next few days.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s far from the best, but sitting and drinking a Starbuck’s capuccino and watching the world go by whilst relaxing and waiting for a train is a long way from unpleasant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The train did arrive, on time, and wasn’t held up on the track anywhere on the way home. Much better than the tram!&lt;/li&gt;

      >&lt;p&gt;My 2nd post on my new 11ty website, listing 3 good things that happened today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Started the day with my regular long espresso made with Brighton Lanes beans from CoffeeCompass.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No clients today, so I made good progress with technical how-to documents for my colleagues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the first time this year I walked the last leg of my journey home under a blue sky with the sun shining!&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>First aid, website and train</title>

      >&lt;p&gt;I’m going to try to get into the habit of listing 3 Good Things that happened during the day.&lt;br /&gt;
Without further ado, here are today’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The First Aid course at work went very well. The trainer hadn’t presented to a Deaf team before, lots of challenges that he hadn’t anticipated (hearing people just don’t). He managed okay thanks to our lovely interpreters. Everyone passed and we await out certificates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My website design choices are finished for now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My evening train wasn’t cancelled and it only took me an hour to travel the 7 miles from work to home.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
